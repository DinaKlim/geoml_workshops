# Description

Our Geo2Data Workshops will focus on building up your practical skills and developing a strong data science foundation.
Our goal with these workshops, is not to help you create the next BIG THING, it is to give you practical exposure. 
Additionally, participants will get join a network of aspiring data scientist in experiencing one of the discipline’s
key rites of passage, hackathons.

# Workshop Agenda

* Workshop Prep (48hrs Prior):
  * Registrants will receive various documents and resources to help them prepare for the workshop.
* 11:00am
  * Intro to Workshop Concepts: This part of the workshop will cover the main concepts explored in the notebooks.
* 11:15am
  * Technical overview of Notebook #1: Cluster Analysis for Rock Typing
  * Description: K-means clustering is used to discover primary rock types in a deep well drilled in the Williston Basin. The project begins by identifying primary rock types for a large section of rock spanning ~9,000’, then focuses on a smaller section of rock (~60’) to identify specific layers in a reservoir. Two unique models are built; however, the process is only covered one time as the only difference is the amount of data fed into the model.
* 11:30am
  * Technical overview of Notebook #2: Exploratory Data Analysis for ~15,000 Oil & Gas Wells in the Williston Basin
  * Description: With Python, SQL and Plotly are used to generate high-level views on oil production from wells in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The Jupyter Notebook can be found on my GitHub. The performance of these wells is governed by two primary sets of factors:
* 11:45am
  * Breakout Rooms: Attendees will be broken out into rooms, each with a dedicated mentor that will answer questions about the concepts covered during the workshop.
* 12:00pm
  * \#SlackHack Kick-Off
    * Description: A fully online hackathon focused on testing your knowledge and grasp of the concepts covered in this workshop. #SlackHack gets its name from the focal point of discussions and networking, our dedicated SIG slack group. In this group, you will be able to receive mentorship throughout the hack. This will also be the place where you will be able to network and meet other data science enthusiast.
    * Hack Deadline: October 20th, 2021
    * Challenge: Use the concepts from the course to create some compelling visuals from the available datasets. Winners will be judged based on:
      1. Novelty of Approach
      2. Application of Workshop Topics
      3. Real World Value of Insights
      
# 1st Place Prize
* Shout-out as #SlackHack winner on the SIG LinkedIn Page
* Your notebook gets put in the SIG GitHub
* Certificate of Recognition
